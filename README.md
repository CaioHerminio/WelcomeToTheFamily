  <h1>🧙‍♂️ The Code Fool's Journey</h1>

  <p><strong>The Fool's Journey</strong> is similar to Joseph Campbell’s famous Hero’s Journey, but instead of 12 stages, it follows 22 stages, based on the 22 Major Arcana of the Tarot. Each card represents an archetype in the evolution of the protagonist, the Fool, who embarks on a path toward knowledge and personal power, just like programmers and artists. </p>

  <h2>💻 My Project</h2>
  <p>Inspired by this narrative, I’m creating <strong>The Code Fool's Journey</strong>, a series of 22 programming projects written in the programming languages I’m currently studying, primarily <strong>Python</strong>, <strong>JavaScript</strong>, and <strong>C++</strong>.</p>

  <h2>📈 The Evolution</h2>
  <p>Each project builds on the previous one, gradually increasing in complexity. The idea is to learn progressively, mastering each concept before moving on to the next. This approach helps prevent the frustration of trying to solve problems beyond our current understanding, and offers a solid roadmap for self-taught learners or educators who value practical projects as learning tools, and for those who, like me, like to learn and compare different languages.</p>

  <h2>🧪 PROJECT 3 - WELCOME TO THE FAMILY</h2>
<p>Carmilla is one of the vampires in literature that predates Dracula and the American tropes of the 20th century onwards. Created by Sheridan Le Fanu in 1872, I was inspired by her to create this little text game. Here, you have been kidnapped by a vampire lady who wants to adopt you, in a bizarre mix of affection and obsession. She asks you some questions to determine your life points, vampiric power and define your rank and class in her family. This program uses a lot of <strong>conditional operators,</strong>strong> which was the focus of this study.</p>
